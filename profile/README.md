# ESP32-SI4732 Radio Receiver

The receiver was designed by a Chinese engineer. His nickname is Sunnygold and he open sourced both hardware (board, 3d-printed and cnc-machined cases) and software. Initially, he didn't knew that the receiver was sold on AliExpress and became popular on YouTube and other communities. Then another Chinese developer Zooc joined him to help improve the firmware.

This GitHub org was created by Max Arnold (R9UCL) and is not official in any way. It is just a collection of notes, source code, plus the excellent docs made by Dave (G8PTN). It also documents [my own fork](https://github.com/esp32-si4732/ats-mini) that is heavily based on the alernative G8PTN firmware (see the full [documentation](https://esp32-si4732.github.io/ats-mini/) here).
